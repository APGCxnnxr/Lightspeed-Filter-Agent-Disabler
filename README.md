# Lightspeed-Filter-Agent-Disabler

** Intructions ( Also on the html ) **

Make sure you have the latest release of the Lightspeed Filter Agent Disabler from the github.

Open the .zip and open the " Lightspeed Filter Agent Disabler.html

Open chrome://extensions in a new tab. Keep this page open.

Go to the settings page for the extension you want to disable. ( Lightspeed Filter Agent Disabler )

On the Lightspeed Filter Agent Disabler, click the "freeze extension" button. Immediately switch back to the chrome://extensions tab.

Back on the chrome://extensions page, spam the "allow access to file URLs" switch for a few seconds.

The extension should now be temporarily disabled. For this effect to persist, flip the "allow access to file URLs" again every few minutes, if pages start getting blocked again, or if it says cannot connect to server/proxy.

You may also need to reopen this page every once in a while to prevent an unavoidable memory leak from crashing the system.
