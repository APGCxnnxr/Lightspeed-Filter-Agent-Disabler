<p>On the Lightspeed Filter Agent Disabler, click the &quot;freeze extension&quot; button. Immediately switch back to the chrome://extensions tab. ( Beta was used for image )</p>

<p>Back on the chrome://extensions page, spam the &quot;allow access to file URLs&quot; switch for a few seconds.</p>

<p>The extension should now be temporarily disabled. For this effect to persist, flip the &quot;allow access to file URLs&quot; again every few minutes, if pages start getting blocked again, or if it says cannot connect to server/proxy. If this doesn&#39;t work refresh your computer.</p>
<p>You may also need to reopen this page every once in a while to prevent an unavoidable memory leak from crashing the system.</p>
<p>IF YOUR WHOLE COMPUTER FREEZES PLEASE RESTART IT. </p>
